# paper-timezone

## About

paper-timezone is a Polymer based web component used for interactively selecting a timezone locale from a map. On smaller screens, the component resizes itself to a dropdown with the ability to let the user select the locale from the dropdown list. It is heavily inspired by the world map on the momentjs site; it in fact is a rewrite of the same in Polymer although with a lot more added features.

We at Blue Water Tracks use it on our portal pages and we wanted to open source the component to share it with the Polymer community. Demos and documentation can be found [here](http://bluewatertracks.github.io/paper-timezone/components/paper-timezone/)
